## DevSecOps: Automating Security Baselines with Infrastructure and Compliance as Code
## Project overview
Capstone is a senior level course designed to allow a student to review, analyze, integrate, and apply technical knowledge in a meaningful and practical manner. The capstone course will be used to integrate concepts from IT curriculum coursework as well as professional and managerial coursework into a project that allows students to put skills into action.

This project focuses on using DevSecOps practices to automate the application of security baselines during system provisioning and deployment. By using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Compliance as Code (CaC), security controls are built directly into the deployment process rather than manually after systems are deployed. This approach promotes consistency, repeatability, and an improved security posture.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how automated deployment packages can apply standardized security baselines throughout a defined software development lifecycle in support of secure design practices. The project emphasizes integrating security into DevOps processes rather than a seperate or reactive step.
This includes:
- Configuration Management
- System provisioning
- Deployment
- Monitoring
- Auditing
- Reporting

## Getting started
1. Clone the shared repo to your local machine:
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/spitlrr/ku-capstone.git
```
2. Change to project directory:
```bash
cd ku-capstone
```
3. Check that your local main branch is up to date:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
4. Create a new feature branch or switch to an existing one:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name
```
```bash
git switch feature/existing-branch-name # switching branches
```
