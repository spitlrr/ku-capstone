## How to contribute
The development of this project is based on a **shared repository model**. It uses a collaborative branching approach that incorporates both a **GitHub Flow** and **feature branch** strategy. This helps ensure that the `main` branch remains clean and stable for project deliverables and provides project members the ability to work on new features, bug fixes, or run independent experiments in isolation without directly disrupting the overall project.

## General housekeeping and best practices
- Try to avoid making direct changes to the `main` branch, as this is where the artifacts we want to keep for our project will be merged into when we are ready such as scripts, config files, docs, etc.
- Feature branches should be quickly deleted once merged into `main`
- Create new feature branches from `main` when starting work on a task, or switch to an existing feature branch that closely aligns with what you are working on.
- Use clear and descriptive branch names based on the type of work being done, such as `feature/` for code or scripts and `docs/` for project documentation, etc.
- Be clear and descriptive when writing commit messages. This not only helps avoid task conflicts but ensures everyone understands what changes were made.
